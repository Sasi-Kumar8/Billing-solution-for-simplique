Implementation Details
1. *Data Archival*:
    - Create an Azure Function (Timer Trigger) to run periodically (e.g., daily).
    - Use Azure Cosmos DB's Change Feed to identify records older than three months.
    - Move these records to Azure Blob Storage.
2. *Data Retrieval*:
    - Create an Azure Function (HTTP Trigger) to handle requests for archived records.
    - Fetch the requested record from Azure Blob Storage and return it to the API.
3. *API Gateway*:
    - Update the existing API to route requests for archived records to the Data Retrieval Azure Function.
